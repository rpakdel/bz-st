See agents.md for complete instructions.

Use the data/minelib/minelib_format.md as a reference for creating minelib file parsers.

All development will be done inside the devContainer. Hence, no need to setup Python environment locally.

Do not implement any functionality unless I explicitly ask for it. We will be implementing this app incrementally together.
 
Always separate data from parsers or calculation modules.
